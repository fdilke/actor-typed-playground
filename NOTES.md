# Notes

## Actor

Stateful beings
Has Mailbox (message queue), FIFO order 
Processes one message at a time !!!
Lightweight
Isolated
State can be change only be sending(receiving) a message
Communicate with other actors only through messages
Don't wait for the response from other actor

Allowed operations:
* create another actor
* send a message
* change it's behavior

Issues:
- be aware about default conf of error handling
- actor's mailbox overflowing
- 

## Why Actors

* to store "shared" mutable state
* to model a Finite State Machine (FSM).
* to simplify the world and forget about concurrency
  

## Error handling

By default, if there is an exception thrown inside a typed actor, the actor is stopped.

## Other
 
* The most important page: [Akka actor typed docs](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/index.html)
* The implementation of the actor is in the same file as test so you can focus on one file

You can think about `Behaviour[T]` as `T => Next Behavior` (simplification)

Behaviors provides many useful factory methods, for instance:
* Behaviors.same
* Behaviors.receiveMessage
* Behaviors.logMessages
* Behaviors.supervise - define what to do in case of error


akka.actor.typed.ActorRef
An ActorRef is the identity or address of an Actor instance. It is valid only during the Actorâ€™s lifetime and allows messages to be sent to that Actor instance. Sending a message to an Actor that has terminated before receiving the message will lead to that message being discarded; such messages are delivered to the [[DeadLetter]] channel.

ActorContext
* creating a child actor
* logging a msg
